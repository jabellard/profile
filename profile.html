			Growing up, I have always had a strong interest in technology. I would break electronic devices to investigate how they work. Unfortunately, breaking electronic devices taught me very little about how they work. I would see the components that made up the device, but had no clue how those components work. This is one of the main reasons why I decided to study computer engineering in college - to learn how electronic devices work, and to learn how to build them myself. Throughout my undergraduate career, I also developed a very strong interest in software development. With time, that interest has only gotten stronger, and I am currently aiming to persue a career in web development.

			In addition to software development, I enjoy picking up heavy objects against the force of gravity (i.e., lifting weights). I also enjoy listening to music.
